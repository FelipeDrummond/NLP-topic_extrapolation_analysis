# NLP-Topic Extrapolation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the generalization capabilities of NLP models across related but distinct datasets. Specifically, it explores how models trained on sentiment analysis datasets can extrapolate to unseen data domains.

## Objective
To evaluate the transferability of language models by:
1. Training models on specific topics from Kaggle datasets
2. Testing their performance on unseen datasets
3. Conducting experiments across three different types of datasets to ensure statistical relevance

## Methodology
1. **Data Selection**: Curate sentiment analysis datasets from Kaggle with varying domains
2. **Model Training**: Train models on source datasets
3. **Extrapolation Testing**: Evaluate model performance on unseen target datasets
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Analyze performance across different data domains

## Datasets
The project will utilize three different types of datasets:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: 
  - Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis: Pre-labeled tweets with sentiment classifications
  - Financial Sentiment Analysis: Text data with sentiment labels from financial contexts
  - Amazon Reviews: Product reviews with ratings (1-5 scale) that will be converted to ternary sentiment labels:
    - Ratings 1-2: Negative
    - Rating 3: Neutral
    - Ratings 4-5: Positive
- **Fake News Detection**: Developing models that can identify misleading or false news articles using labeled news datasets
- **Spam Detection**: Building classifiers to distinguish between legitimate and spam messages/emails, testing transferability of learned features across different communication platforms
